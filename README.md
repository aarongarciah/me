# Xavier Cazalot page (former Cazalot Bros page)

Work in progress demo: http://xavcz.github.io/cazalot-bros/

### Goals
1. Showcase my job, consultant software engineer
2. Work on my design & front-end skills

### Trigger
I need a page to show why SaaS businesses should hire me.

### Problem
My current page, http://xav.cz, is not really engaging. It's my first attempt with React, back in February 2016, and it's a fork of my brother's page, http://cyg.fr

### Solution
Apply what I learnt in the past month with different workshops (Frontend Masters, Designlab) and hacking on my own with clients and open-source work.
