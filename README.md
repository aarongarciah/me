# Xavier Cazalot page (former Cazalot Bros page)

##### Goals
1. Make more profit as consultant software engineer
2. Work on my design & front-end skills

##### Trigger
I need a page to show why SaaS businesses should hire me.

##### Problem
My current page, http://xav.cz, is not really engaging. It's my first attempt with React, back in February 2016, and it's a fork of my brother's page, http://cyg.fr

##### Solution
Apply what I learnt in the past month with different workshops (Frontend Masters, Designlab) and hacking on my own with clients and open-source work.

##### What this will look like:
