# Xavier Cazalot page
#### Powered by [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) 

Work in progress demo: http://xavcz.github.io/cazalot-bros/

### Goals
1. Showcase my job, consultant software engineer
2. Work on my design & front-end skills
3. Apply what I learnt being curious (Frontend Masters, Designlab)

### Trigger
I need a page to show why SaaS businesses should hire me.

### Path is made walking

The first version was my first React app ever, February 2016, and was a fork from my brother's static HTML page, http://cyg.fr.

I then moved to an exploration on how to build an UI from a Sketch file (see below), using Block-Element-Modifier methodology and Flexbox.

I also tried [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), along with an express server for the mailing.

Latest version is powered by Elm ðŸ˜Ž
